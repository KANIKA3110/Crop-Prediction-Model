# Crop-Prediction-Model

Team Name : ELITE THUNDER


Problem Statement -8  : Develop a Machine Learning Model that can predict the crop to be grown according to the factor given by farmer.

This project deals with the visualisation of some data taken from the Indian Chamber of food and agriculture and then builds a model accordingly which can help the farmers to predict the type of crop they should grow according to the various factors involved.

The data fields involved in the dataset are:

N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
P - ratio of Phosphorus content in soil
K - ratio of Potassium content in soil
Temperature - temperature in degree Celsius
Humidity - relative humidity in %
Ph - pH value of the soil
Rainfall - rainfall in mm
 
The libraries used in the study are:
Numpy
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Sklearn (ML algorithms).
 
1st part (Visualisation):
In this we identify one to one relationship of variables with crops
Using graph and bars(Matlpotlib).
 
In 2nd part (Applying Machine Learning) :
In this we applied few ML algorithms to check the Training score and Test score of every model.
Machine Learning Algorithms applied are :-
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forests
GradientBoosting Classifier
Support Vector Classifier
Logistic Regression
 
* Linear Regression : 
Training score : 0.865
Test score : 0.877
*  Decision Tree Classifier :
Training score : 1.000
Test score : 0.990
*  Random Forests :
Training score : 1.000
Test score : 0.990
*  GradientBoostingClassifier :
Training score : 1.000
Test score : 0.990
*  Support Vector Classifier :
Training score : 1.000
Test score : 1.000
*  Logistic Regression :
Training score : 1.000
Test score : 1.000

* 3rd Part: 
Final Step we have developed a Prediction Model using KNeighborsClassifier Algorithm to predict the crops with Python GUI.
